First run npx ccstatulsline@latest to set up your statusline as you like then run the following prompt in Claude Opus 4.6:

```
/statusline i want to modify my status line to just add 1 extra line that shows my current logged in account email nothing else i want everything else about my status line to remain exactly as it is i want you to understand ccstatusline before you implement your changes please. repo is here: https://github.com/sirmalloc/ccstatusline       
                                                                                                                                              
and you can clone the repo (clone main branch only) and look through it if you need to do that to understand how to add the email without messing with other things i have configured. please take backup before messing with my claude setting files also keep in mind your folder is here: ~/.claude-profiles/personal and here: ~/.claude-profiles/work NOT here: ~/.claude

Keep in mind that i have 2 aliases in .zshrc that i use to launch claude in personal or work profile 1 is `c` and the other is `cs` you please make sure that the email shown is different when i launch the different profile. It's should show xyzt70@gmail.com when i launch with the personal profile (using c) and yahia@shortpoint.com when i launch claude using cs.
```
